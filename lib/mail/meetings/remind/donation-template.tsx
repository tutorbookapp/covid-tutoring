          Thanks to your generosity, we have raised over $30,000 for the CDC
          foundation to support COVID-related efforts. We have decided to switch
          our charity to the Save the Music Foundation, a national organization
          that partners with local communities and school districts to provide
          instruments, invest in music technology, help teachers with curriculum
          and professional development, and generally support music education in
          public schools. With your help, we can give thousands of kids across
          the country exposure to music in the same way that many of our
          teachers were first able to.
